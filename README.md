# Multiplatform Mobile App Development with Web Technologies Ionic and Cordova

In particular we make use of the Cordova hybrid application framework to develop and target multiple mobile platforms with a single codebase. We make use of the Ionic framework (Ionic Ver 3.x), one of the most popular mobile application frameworks, that is built with mobile-optimized HTML5 and CSS based components and Angular. I learnt about UI development with Ionic and then using Cordova's modules to access the native mobile platform's capabilities from Javascript.
At the end of this project I was able to:
*	Build mobile applications targeting multiple platforms with a single codebase
*	Leverage my HTML5, CSS, Javascript and Angular skills
*	Use various features of the Ionic framework to build hybrid mobile applications.
